# Example Memory Entry

This is an example of how to structure memory entries in your workspace.

## Purpose

Memory entries are for storing important information that Claude should remember across conversations. This could include:

- Preferences and working styles
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Common patterns or solutions you use
- Important project context

## Format Guidelines

- Always include frontmatter with name, created-at, and updated-at fields
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Keep entries focused and specific
- Update the updated-at field when making changes

## Usage

Use the `/remember` command to create new memory entries automatically, or create them manually following this template.
